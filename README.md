# Snakes
 
The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food , trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.

In this game I use
-Bound to get the food swan boundaries
-Transform list to save the position and get the position of head and others parts of the Snake
-Destroy function to delete the snake and reset the game
-Speed Orb to increase the speed of the snake for certain seconds
-Pass Through Orb to pass over the snake itself
